Our company history: Beverly Hills Black was created as a partnership between two friends who have both managed companies in the luxury black car chauffeur industry in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. We were dissatisfied with the quality of the software platforms employed by similar local chauffeur services and knew our expertise in web technology could offer customers a more seamless and fulfilling user experience. Our goal is to make black SUV and van charter service modern and minimal, not clunky and out-of-date. Luxury means luxury and your software experience should reflect that.

Have your own black car or limo company? Want to take advantage of our cutting edge-software and marketing techniques? Partner with us and grow. Learn more about the different types of partnerships we offer on our website: https://beverlyhillsblack.com/partners/
